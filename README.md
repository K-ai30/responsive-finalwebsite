# Responsive Final Website

Updated responsive final website with portfolio, social media, CSS, and Bootstrap

### Description

This project was created to design a more mobile-first portfolio site that captures a more creative-side compared to the original portfolio sites it was modeled after.  The challenges with this project were in adapting the formatting and customization through bootstrap elements and creating a dynamic and functional layout.  Ultimately, the benefits of using external style sheets (organization, specific targeting, and visibility) helped resolve issues regarding which elements were being impacted with each line of code.

### Notes

I started building this website to serve as my portfolio site to showcase my coding projects. However, this project could be adapted to provide a basic framework for any type of basic website.  To that end, I hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the site.
